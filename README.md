## Introduction

ScanMe is a versatile mobile application built with React Native that aims to provide a user-friendly interface for working with QR codes. Whether you need to scan QR codes, create QR codes from text, extract text from images, or generate WiFi QR codes, ScanMe has you covered. With its intuitive design and straightforward functionality, ScanMe is a valuable tool for various scenarios.

## Features

### Scan QR Codes

Easily scan QR codes using the device's camera and quickly access the embedded information. This feature is useful for reading QR codes containing URLs, contact information, product details, and more.

### Text to QR Code

Convert any text or string into a QR code. This can be handy for sharing long strings of text, URLs, or any information that can be conveniently stored within a QR code.

### Image to Text

Extract text from images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Simply take a picture of the text, and ScanMe will convert it into editable and shareable text.

### WiFi QR Code

Generate WiFi QR codes to simplify the process of sharing WiFi network credentials. Users can scan the generated QR code to automatically connect to the specified WiFi network, eliminating the need for manual entry of credentials.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run ScanMe on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ATICHOF/scanme.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd scanme`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Use a mobile emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to launch the application on your device.

## Usage

Once ScanMe is up and running, you can explore its features through the user-friendly interface. Here's a brief overview of how to use each feature:

- **Scan QR Codes:** Open the app and point your device's camera at a QR code. The app will automatically detect and interpret the QR code's content.

- **Text to QR Code:** Enter the desired text in the provided input field. The app will generate a QR code representing the input text.

- **Image to Text:** Select the "Image to Text" feature, then choose an image containing text from your device's gallery. The app will process the image and display the extracted text.

- **WiFi QR Code:** Select the "WiFi QR Code" feature and enter your WiFi network's credentials. The app will generate a QR code that, when scanned, allows users to connect to the WiFi network easily.
